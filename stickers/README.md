## Readme - Azure Tips and Tricks Artwork
----------------------
 
Based on the written blog post series of [Azure Tips and Tricks](http://azuredev.tips/). This is a collection of stickers that I've used at events and community meetups - now available to you. 

## How to print?

Select the design that you want and use [Sticker Mule](https://www.stickermule.com/) to print high-quality, color correct, stickers. 

## Software and File Type used

The application used to create all of the images was Adobe Illustrator. After creation, we exported to EPS so that transferring image data between different operating systems would be easier. The EPS file type is supported by several different drawing programs and vector graphic editing applications.

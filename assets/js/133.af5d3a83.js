So if it runs locally it will also run in Azure.\nAlso, Web Apps for Containers comes with some cool features, like the ability to use deployment slots, which means that you can publish a new version of your app in a slot and test it. And once you are ready, you can swap the slot into production with almost no downtime. And, as you saw in this post, you can use Windows containers in Web Apps for Containers.
